Q:

Why are Kore and Persephone interchangeable in the myth regarding Hades wife?

In Greek mythology, Kore and Persephone were interchangeable as Hades' wife.  Which is it? Kore or Persephone?

A:

Kore was the Ancient Greek word for young girl, the equivalent of our maiden, and Persephone was often referred to as such to highlight her innocence. 

A:

I've read that when she was young she was called Core (maiden), and after she was kidnapped she changed her name to Persephone (bringer of destruction/death).
I see it as a sort of coming of age thing.
This is from the book (graphic novel, actually) Hades : Lord of the Dead by George O'Connor. Oâ€™Connor draws from primary documents to reconstruct and retell classic Greek myths.
It's possible that my book dramatized that a bit and she didn't necessarily choose it herself in the original myths.
