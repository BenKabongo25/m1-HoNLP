Q:

Purpleheart sustainability and environmental responsibility

My local hardwood retailer has a ton of purpleheart for sale. It's gorgeous and I'd love to play with it.
(Ha.)
But, I've been told, and online research semi-confirms, that this stuff comes from rapidly disappearing rainforests. I don't want to contribute to that.
Are there other, sustainable sources for purpleheart? Is it not, in fact, endangered? Is there any way to verify that what I'm buying didn't involve the destruction of 10,000 different species of Things that can Move?
(TL;DR: How to responsibly buy hardwood without trashing the rest of the world.)

A:

Purpleheart is not listed in the CITES Appendices or on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  So it would not be generally considered "endangered".
My understanding is that in the environments where it is found naturally it grows very quickly, so while there is a limited supply it is also easily renewable.
