Q:

Suggestions to attach these coffee table legs

I was 'gifted' this coffee table from my dumpster-diving father and am currently in the process of refinishing it. It's made of some nice, very hard and heavy wood I'm not familiar with; teak or mahogany if I had to guess. Anyways I'm not sure how to attach the legs in a stable manner. As shown in the pictures, the legs previously extended to the table top and were held on with some pocket screws and angle brackets. Any suggestions to attach them more securely while maintaining the size of the table (i.e. not chopping off the ends of the table)?

A:

I procrastinated this for quite a while but ended up going a completely different direction from what I was thinking initially. Couldn't find an elegant way to connect the legs with the original style so I flushed up the ends of the table, then made 2 legs from ripping the original 4 in half and joining them together. I then connected it to the table by routing a groove and securing them with some threaded inserts. Finished with some wipe-on poly.
Side note: whatever wood this is (perhaps jarrah or merbau as as suggested)did not play nicely with my respiratory system. Even with wearing a mask, I had nasty allergy symptoms for nearly a week after sanding it.
