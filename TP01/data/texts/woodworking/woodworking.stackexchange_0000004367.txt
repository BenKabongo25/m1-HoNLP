Q:

Use Baby oil instead of mineral oil on cutting boards

I use mineral oil when I make cutting boards because it makes it pop. But I have not been finding any. Would baby oil be a good or decent replacement? Is there any other oils that would work, maybe even better than mineral oil?

A:

Baby oil is just mineral oil with fragrance added - so you're not going to kill anyone, but there may be a smell..
I normally use Olive Oil on cutting boards.
