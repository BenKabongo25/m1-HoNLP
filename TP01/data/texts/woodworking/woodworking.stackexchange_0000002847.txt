Q:

Can I use lacquer over an epoxy resin?

I put an epoxy resin on a table top and it looks awesome except for a few spots that bubbled or had dust fall on it. I would like to sand the top down smooth/level and put a thin layer of lacquer on top. I would like to use spray lacquer. Will this stick? Or should I use a different method. I am limited to about 2 days to work on this table before it needs to be used for the holidays.

A:

Lacquer can stick to epoxy. How secure the bond is depends on a few factors but if you provide a textured surface for a mechanical bond to form — as you do when you sand — that gives the best chance for a reliable result. 
I should caution that people have had very mixed results trying to repair/restore the surface of epoxy with varnish and lacquer. At worst apparently the scratches remain clearly visible in the epoxy surface underneath the topcoat, they don't get 'wetted' by the topcoat as they would if you were applying over a layer of the same finish. 
Normally this would mean I'd recommend you do a test or two but you don't have the time so I would either live with the blemishes for now, or just bite the bullet and go for it with the lacquer and hope for the best.
