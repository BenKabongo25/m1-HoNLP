Q:

Can I use glasses-cleaning leather to make a strop?

I am having difficulties finding some scrap piece of leather in order to make myself a strop in order to aid the sharpening process for my plane blades and chisels.

I was thinking to use this kind of (hopefully) genuine leather and I am not sure if it is a good idea. I mean the oxide-loaded strop:

Is it feasible?

A:

To answer the question at hand, no. This is not appropriate material for stropping tool edges.
Let's aggregate the answers that popped up in comments:

Look around for a local leatherworker to acquire scraps of heavier hide suitable for turning into a strop
Check charity shops for an old "full grain" leather belt (i.e., not compressed or bonded leather)

A:

I agree with the prior answer and comments and thought I would add another suggestion to try.  A very flat smooth piece of wood such as a finish grade plywood makes a great strop or base for a leather strop.
I have piece of plywood that I applied stropping compound to and it works great.  As a woodworker it easy to make a strop like this of any size or shape you like with or without a handle.  And you are pretty much guaranteed to have the material laying in your scrap bin right now.
