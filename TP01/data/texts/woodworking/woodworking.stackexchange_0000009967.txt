Q:

Outgassing of oil-modified polyurethane

We recently (a month ago) had our oak floors refinished with Precision Oil Modified Polyurethane. The odor has diminished substantially, and I hardly notice it at all any more, except sometimes when I first enter the house. 
But my partner is worried about the toxicity and has the windows open and many fans on during much of the day. Until the other day, we thought that the finish was purely oil-based, but from other articles on this site, it appears that it mainly water-based -- which we thought we had been avoiding due to concerns about appearance and durability.  
Is she right to be so worried about the toxicity? How long should we be subject to outgassing, and are fans the best way to speed up the process?  (In a few weeks, it might not be so comfortable to keep the windows open.)

A:

The odour from waterbased finishes can sometimes be surprisingly strong and pervasive, but there's usually little cause for concern because the ingredients are relatively benign, and certainly the VOC load is just a fraction of that from an equivalent oil-based finish. But, what you're smelling in each case are completely different things. 

Is she right to be so worried about the toxicity? 

I'd say the answer to this is probably not, but there's no point in someone here speculating on what you're smelling in this case and the risk it may pose, contact the manufacturer and they'll be able to put your mind at rest. 

How long should we be subject to outgassing

Impossible to say. In all finishing drying processes take as long as they take, depending on the exact product used (not just its type) and subject to the temp and humidity, the thickness of finish application etc.

and are fans the best way to speed up the process? 

Yes. Good airflow is the number one thing that will help.
