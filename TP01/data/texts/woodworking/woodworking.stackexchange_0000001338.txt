Q:

Can I make a dado blade set out of multiple regular blades?

Lets say, for argument sake, that I have 2 or 3 10" blades for my table saw. That would give me just under 3/8 inches, when all mounted together, which I could use to make dadoes. 
With what I have available this would be easier than constantly stopping my saw to adjust my fence to enlarge my dadoes. 
I could easily see this being a bad idea since the blade kerfs could touch while the saw is operating. Also sawdust might get stuck between the blades. Has anyone tried this before?

A:

There's another factor you're not considering: torque requirements. There's a reason the majority of dado sets are 6" or 8" in diameter. Most table saws won't have the power to run a 10" set. A 10" set will require 25% more torque than an 8" set, and 67% more torque than a 6" set.
Not surprisingly, Matthias over at Woodgears has written an article about doing more or less the same thing you're proposing. Except he solves the torque problem by using multiple 7-1/4" blades.

A:

Instead of making a dado blade you can instead use a sled and then move the workpiece side to side on that to enlarge the dado. Make the outer cuts first and then you have a reference for where the blade should go; the middle cuts aren't that important to get accurate.
Or set the fence for the left most cut and clamp a piece of wood the with the same thickness of as the width of the desired dado minus the kerf of the blade.
You make the cut and then remove the block on the fence and cut again. then between those positions you can cut repeatedly and clean up with a chisel.
