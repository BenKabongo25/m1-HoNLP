Q:

Taking apart a wood cabinet that has been glued together with Gorilla Glue

Is there away to take apart a wood cabinet that has been glued together with Gorilla Glue without destroying the wood?

A:

Gorilla Glue is a polyurethane-based adhesive.  As such, you might be able to use a solvent that dissolves polyurethane to try to break down the adhesive and remove the glue.  Likely you will have to let it sit and constantly reapply the solvent to get the polyurethane to break down.
We just had a Question about storing solvents that you will find helpful in determining what might dissolve your Gorilla Glue.  Some solvents that may work are:

ethyl alcohol (the kind you can drink)
methyl alcohol (only drink it if you want to go blind)
lacquer thinner
