Q:

Who wrote "projective geometry" for the first time?

I guess Desargues did not use that term. Anyone could help me know where did it appear for the first time? Thanks

A:

I looked in MathWords and found this

PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY. In his account of the origins of projective geometry Katz (1993) mentions Pascal, Desargues and Monge before saying that J.-V.Poncelet composed the first text in synthetic projective geometry: his Traité des Propriétés Projectives of 1822. See here for an extract from Poncelet’s Introduction.
The OED finds the term projective geometry used in English in 1885 in Charles Leudesdorf’s Elements of Projective Geometry, a translation of Cremona’s Elementi di geometria proiettiva of 1873.

So, perhaps the first use in English was 1885, but that was a translation from Italian.  First uses in other languages are (of course) not answered by this.
