Q:

Why was 0000 chosen to be the start of the calendar?

What's the significance of date 0000? Why was this day chosen to be the start of the calendar?
What comes before 0000? I know they say 1BC. But then shouldn't current time be called AD?
Don't know if 0000 is termed as Year Zero

A:

In the common counting (in history) there is no year zero. Our common calendar
begins with year 1 AD preceded by year 1 BC. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_era,
chapter Dionysian Common Era.
Of course this is inconvenient for astronomy. 
So astronomers sometimes use year 0,
which is the same as 1 BC in the common system, and then use negative numbers
for the preceding years. See the same article, chapter Dionysian derived.
For other, more convenient systems used in astronomy, see the same article, and
the article "Julian Day" in Wikipedia, they place year 0 further in the past, so that all events in the recorded history have positive year numbers.
