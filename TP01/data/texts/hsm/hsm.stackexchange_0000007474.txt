Q:

First appearance of the term sinus cardinalis

Who introduced the term sinus cardinalis? I do not mean the abbreviation sinc, which was introduced 1952 by Woodward.

A:

According to sources quoted in Wikipedia's sinc "talk" page, 

The name sinus cardinalis dates back by Edmund T. Whittaker in 1915,
  where he named the bandlimited or most simple function of a family of
  cotabular functions (sharing a function table, i.e., values at equally
  spaced sample points) the cardinal function of this family. One would
  have to check if he already named the basis functions or if that came
  later. See A History of interpolation.--LutzL (talk)

Following that "talk" link leads to a history page  which includes an image from that paper, From E. T. Whittaker, "On the Functions which are Represented by the Expansions of Interpolation-Theory", Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. 35, 1915, pp. 181-194
