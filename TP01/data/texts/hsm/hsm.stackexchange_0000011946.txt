Q:

How large were the differences in the orbit of Uranus which led to the calculation of the existence of Neptune?

After Uranus was discovered and its orbit calculated, its future orbit was calculated, and its future positions as seen from Earth were calculated.
And observers of Uranus began to notice that Uranus was deviating from its calculated positions. Eventually the possibility that an undiscovered planet was perturbing the orbit of Uranus was used by Adams and Le Verrier to calculate the orbit of Neptune and led to the discovery of Neptune.
So how large in angles and/or in miles/kilometers were the deviations in the apparent position of Uranus that were used to calculate the orbit and apparent position of Neptune?

A:

Starting off with a crude order-of-magnitude estimate, the anomalous acceleration of Uranus ($m_1$) due to Neptune ($m_2$) should be on the order of $Gm_1m_2/a^2$, where $a$, a scale for the distance between the two planets, can be taken to equal the radius of Uranus's orbit. The secular trend probably vanishes, so let's take the time of interaction to be on the order of Uranus's orbital period, which is given by Kepler's laws. Then ignoring universal factors of order unity, the displacement of Uranus should be $\Delta x\sim (m_2/m_S)a$, where $m_S$ is the mass of the sun. This results in an angular displacement  $\Delta\theta\sim\Delta x/a\sim m_2/m_S\sim 10''$.
In terms of actual observation, here is a graph of the residuals from Danjon, 1946:

The simple order-of-magnitude estimate agrees reasonably well with the observations. Presumably people at the time did some kind of estimate similar to this in order to estimate $m_2$, and the fact that it was on the right order of magnitude for a planet encouraged them to hypothesize a new planet.
The relative orbital period $1/(1/T_1-1/T_2)$ is 170 years, which seems to equal, to within a factor 2, the time-scale for the observed oscillations in the residuals. This could have been estimated from Bode's law, which would further support the hypothesis of a new planet.
What seems to be a much more difficult problem is to estimate the new planet's orbital elements and the uncertainty of those elements, hence the controversy between supporters of Adams and Le Verrier.
