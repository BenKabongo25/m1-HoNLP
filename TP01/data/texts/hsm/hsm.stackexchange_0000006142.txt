Q:

Where are the mirrors of the historic telescopes today?

Are the great mirrors and lenses of historic telescopes preserved? Those of Herschel and Rosse and many others and back to the 18th and 17th centuries. The wooden structures of those telescopes I can imagine rottened and became firewood. But didn't they preserve the mirrors and lenses in some basement because they didn't know what to do with them?
What historic telescope mirrors are being conserved?

A:

Many of these objects are collected in museums. The German "Deutsches Museum" for instance keeps famous original instruments of Fraunhofer http://www.deutsches-museum.de/sammlungen/meisterwerke/meisterwerke-ii/refraktor/ Such institutions are scattered all over the globe.
Further there are many museums devoted to individual astronomers like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_Museum_of_Astronomyreplica
keeping original relics and replica.
Most relics will have been preserved at their original places. The GÃ¶ttingen Sternwarte keeps original instruments used by Gauss. A list of such institutions would get fairly long.
