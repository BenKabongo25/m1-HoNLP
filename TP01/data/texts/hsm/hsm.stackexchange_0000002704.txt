Q:

Did Archimedes know about Callipus?

Various sources, such as Cicero's Republic state that Archimedes had made a machine consisting of glass spheres that represented the Eudoxian system of the world. 
Considering that Callipus died over a decade before Archimedes was born, would Archimedes have been aware of Callipus' work and therefore would his mechanism use the full 34 spheres needed to account for planetary movement as Callipus suggested instead of the 27 used by Eudoxus?

A:

There is no definite answer on this question. About the Archimedes machine we only know a very imprecise description from the authors who did not understand much about this machine, or about science in general. What Archimedes knew and what he did not we cannot tell for sure. Probably he knew about Callipus. Probably he visited Alexandria. Alexandria at that time had a library, and one may suppose it contained all important writings on mathematics and astronomy. There are no reasons to assume that Callipus writings were missing since he lived recently....
But there is no firm ground for all these speculations.
