Q:

Historically accurate alternatives to "Men of Mathematics"?

I have heard that the book "Men of Mathematics" by E. Bell is a very entertaining text composed of several biographies of a number of influential mathematicians, and is in fact one of the most popular popular mathematics books to date. I have also heard that E. Bell received more than a little criticism for his writings, due to the large number of embellishments and historical inaccuracies, as well as the less than inclusive title and contents. Up until now, I have avoided "Men of Mathematics" for this reason.
I am quite interested in the history of mathematics, though, and would like to read a book with a similar subject matter to "Men of Mathematics", except one written less to entertain and more to educate, without such criticisms. I have already read around a bit on the subject, for example I have read Boyer's textbook, but haven't found a history book exclusively focused on studying the lives of influential figures, yet. 
I understand that mathematics is collaborative, so the impact of these figures is less than the average casual followers of the subject would think, but I am interested in learning about them nonetheless.

Try Journey Through Genius, by William Dunham.
Every chapter mixes historical account with a mathematical discussion of a landmark theorem.
