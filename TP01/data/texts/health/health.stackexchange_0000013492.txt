Q:

Does the use of sunscreen inhibit Vitamin D production?

Vitamin D is produced in the skin when exposed to sunlight.
Therefore, when using sunscreen on the skin, is Vitamin D production inhibited?

A:

This has been a controversial question for many years. The current evidence suggests that sunscreen does block a part of Vitamin D production, but with negligible amounts.

Studies have found that by blocking ultraviolet rays, sunscreen limits
  the vitamin D we produce. But the question is to what extent.
A few studies have concluded that the effect is significant â€” a
  reduction as great as tenfold. But more recent, randomized studies
  that followed people for months and in some cases years suggest that
  the effect is negligible. While sunscreen does hamper vitamin D
  production, these studies say, it is not enough to cause a deficiency.
[...]
  Dr. Lim added that rather than cutting back on sunscreen, people
  concerned about vitamin D should consume more foods rich in vitamin D,
  like salmon, milk and orange juice.
