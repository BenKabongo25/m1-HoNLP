Q:

Is it necessary to hydrate before doing a double red cell blood donation?

So, I gave blood today, as is my habit about every 112 days, going on the apharesis machine to do a double red donation. After the donation, as usual, I found myself having to urinate more often than usual. That's when it struck me. They still give the advice to be well hydrated before donation (and to eat a good meal), but the double red donation has the fluid being taken out replaced by saline solution before it's injected back in. Is drinking a few extra glasses of water before an apharesis donation necessary or even recommended?

A:

According to the Stanford Blood Center and the American Society for Apharesis,  you should increase your intake of fluids, calcium, and iron at least two days before your platelet donation appointment â€“ this will help prevent negative donation reactions.
