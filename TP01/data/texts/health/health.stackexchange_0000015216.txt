Q:

How can people suffering from Ankylosing Spondylitis manage their weight

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis in which there is long term inflammation of the joints of the spine. Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time.

People suffering from Ankylosing Spondylitis are often gaining weight. Lowered physical activity means they are often excluded from countering that with exercise (more sports) since the pain prevents them from doing so.
Is there a better option than relying on (pain inducing) exercise to maintain or loose weight when someone has AS?

A:

To answer your question, Yes. You can focus on boosting your metabolism since you can't freely do sport. 
To answer the person that downvoted my answer, we can see that boosting one's metabolism is a commonly used concept in approved Health SE sources. E.g. based on this article on WebMD: 

Can you change your metabolism? Yes. Whether you're born with a fast,
  average, or slow metabolism, there are things you can do to speed
  yours up or slow it down.

Here are some suggestions which I've put in application in my own life. Hope it helps somebody out there.
Intermittent fasting:
The idea is to extend as much as possible the fasting period around your sleep. E.g. to give myself as an example, I eat two times per day, once at noon and once at 6PM, fulfilling complete meals. 

Some research shows that intermittent fasting works. In one study,
  overweight adults who cut calories by 20% every other day dropped 8%
  of their body weight within 8 weeks. They also had less inflammation.

Drink green tea/coffee throughout the day

In a small study, green tea appeared to raise metabolic rates and
  speed up fat oxidation.
