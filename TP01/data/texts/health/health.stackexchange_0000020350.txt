Q:

Would gargling salt water every day increase sodium absorption levels?

Do you absorb sodium through your gums, mouth and throat when gargling and rinsing salt water? Considering the fact that sublingual medication is a very effective way for introducing substances straight into your bloodstream very quickly. 
Below's a link to a study on Pubmed about this issue, but I don't have access. Does anyone here have access?  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3474267/

A:

Yes, there is increase in sodium absorption levels after rinsing mouth with salt water. This absorption is through oral mucosal lining. Increase in sodium is very little as compared to the daily requirement of sodium. 
In the clinical study (link mentioned in question), 5% saline solution (which contains 855 mEq of sodium) was used. Sodium absorbed by various participants was between 2 to 11 mEq, and the minimum requirement of daily sodium dosage is 44 mEq. So, this will pose little risk on metabolic process. And it is possible that on increasing saline concentration of mouth rinse, sodium absorption may also increase. So, 5% Saline solution is recommended for mouth rinsing.

Earlier in 1950's various researchers have reported the use of sodium salts of various drugs for sublingual absorption.
