Q:

Can a calorie be neither protein, carbohydrate, nor fat?

I recently started using MyFitnessPal to try to lose weight and I noticed that a particular beer I had drunk has a tremendous number of calories relative to the number of grams of carbs it contains compared to something like rice or oatmeal.  This ended up being a problem for me, because it made it harder for me to hit my macro goals for the day without going over my daily calorie limit.
The nutritional information might be incorrect (this beer isn't from a country that I totally trust the nutritional labels for), or the person who put the nutritional information into MyFitnessPal might have done it incorrectly. I do remember hearing that beer has a lot of carbohydrates, which would seem to go against what I'm saying here.
So: Can a calorie be neither protein, carbohydrate, nor fat?

A:

Ethanol is caloric and is neither a carbohydrate, protein, or fat.
