Q:

Is Ayurveda treatment effective for modern diseases?

Ayurveda is an ancient treatment from India which is 3000 years old, based on experience and observation. 
Is Ayurveda good against modern diseases like tuberculosis, cancer etc?

A:

Honestly, the only way we can see if Ayurveda works is through rigorous peer-reviewed research that involves statistical methodology (randomized control trials) and double-blind studies. The reason this is important to mention is because a lot of studies of alternative medicine are unable to be replicated by other researchers, which implies flaws in the study design.
