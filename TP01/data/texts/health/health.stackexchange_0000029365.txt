Q:

Ritalin/Concerta/Methylphenidate is an amphetamine?

FIDE says here:

The most relevant banned substances for chess are:

• Amphetamines – e.g. Adderall, Ritalin

(...)

I think either Ritalin should be in a separate category called methylphenidate or Adderall and Ritalin are categorised under 'stimulants (that you need a prescription for but don't have)' (then you can add vyvanse, desoxyn, concerta, etc) or something because afaik Ritalin/Concerta/Methylphenidate is not an amphetamine.
Or am I wrong: is Ritalin/Concerta/Methylphenidate actually an amphetamine?

A:

The Adderall vs. Ritalin page on Rx List  gives the answer.

Both Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) and Ritalin (methylphenidate) are central nervous system stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD].
Methylphenidate (also sold as Concerta) isn't an amphetamine and its effects tend to be milder than those of Adderall. Patients also report a more pronounced effect on cognitive function and thought processes when taking Ritalin as opposed to Adderall, which comes with a number of effects on the body such as increased heart rate and others.

I would imagine that the reason for it to be banned in chess is that

Ritalin may help increase attention and decrease impulsiveness.

Therefore, it could potentially create an unfair advantage to those who are under the influence.
However, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) do have Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs). This allows those suffering from ADHD for example, to continue their medication therapy as long as they satisfy strict criteria. (See the USADA webpage for more)

Athletes with ADHD can continue using necessary prohibited stimulant medications while competing in sanctioned sports as long as they receive a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE), which requires them to demonstrate that they can satisfy strict criteria for TUE approval.
