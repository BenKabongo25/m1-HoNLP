Q:

How to calculate quadcopter lift capabilities?

I'm looking for an equation (or set of equations) that would allow me to predict (with fair accuracy) how heavy a payload a quadcopter is capable of lifting.
I assume the main variables would be the weight of the copter as well as the size + power of the 4 rotors. What general approach can one use to make such a determination?

This depends on what you want to do with your copter.
Hovering: 100-150 Watt/kg 
ScaleFlight: 200-300 Watt/kg 
Some chilling acrobatic flight: 350-400 Watt/kg
3D acrobatics 500+ Watt/kg
Hardcore 3D 1000 Watt/kg
Just take your motors and your flight style and you got some values for the max weight of your copter
I also have a source for this but i know only a German one: http://www.heli-planet.de/index.php?section=auslegung_von_e_motoren
This values are pretty accurate. There are mathmatical ways to calculate the lift of your quadrotor but they are a very theoretical approach. You have to think about the enviorment, the wind, air pressure, reaction speed, controlability.
